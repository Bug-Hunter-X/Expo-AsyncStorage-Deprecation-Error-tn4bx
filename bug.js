This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in Expo. The error message is typically: `AsyncStorage: AsyncStorage has been deprecated in favor of MMKV. Please install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage instead and follow the upgrade guide.` This happens because AsyncStorage is deprecated in favor of MMKV, a more performant and reliable alternative.  This is not an error in your code per se but a result of using a deprecated Expo module.
